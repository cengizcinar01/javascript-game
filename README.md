# JavaScript Game

In this game, players click on flying ravens to score points. When a raven is clicked, it triggers an explosion animation and sound. The game tracks the player's score and displays a "Game Over" message when a raven exits the screen.

## Features

-   **Raven Enemies:** Characterized by random flight patterns and colors, they provide a dynamic challenge.
-   **Interactive Explosions:** Players can click on ravens to trigger explosions and earn points.
-   **Particle Effects:** Each raven can leave a trail of colored particles, enriching the visual experience.
